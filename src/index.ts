/**
 * This is a recreation of the IDL things that are defined in the API spec. We
 * are exporting the non-global things like `IDBReqestReadyState` as types only.
 * The global things like `indexedDB` are exported as values. Note that if the
 * `indexedDB` property of the window were a getter, we would need to do a bit
 * more cajolling to make it so that `indexedDB` wasn't "gotten" (trigger the
 * getter) until a `Proxy` wrapper told it to "get". But since it's not, we can
 * just export it as a value. ðŸ˜Š
